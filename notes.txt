RESTFUL API
==============

1. What is a RESTful API?
REresentational State Transfter
Transfer data around
Client -> Server relationship - MVC Paradigm 

Examples:
Client (Mobile App)
Access to third-party
Send data, and get data so it can be used in our code
Client (browser/SPA)

STATELESS BACKENDS, don't care about individual client which connects to them.

SEND A REQUEST, HANDLE A RESPONSE
Server with url's supported by the server by endpoints -> send AJAX (async http request)
ie.             /users              /posts          /products
HTTP VERBS:  GET|POST|DELETE      GET|POST|PATCH        GET

AJAX allows us to get information back without refreshing a page
